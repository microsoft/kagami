Extract the following entities from the text between <|Start_Text|> and <|End_Text|>.  
- `Duration`: this is the length of the study performed  
- `Species`: this is the species of the test subjects  
- `DrugOrCompound`: this is the drug or compound used in the study  
- `RouteOfAdministration`: this is the manner or route which the drug or compound was administered  
- `InternalStudyNumber`: this is the internal study number, generally follows format "TKD-BCS-00000" where 00000 is a 5 digit number  
- `ExternalStudyNumber`: this is the external study number  
- `TestFacility`: this is the name of the test facility  
   
Important:    
- Every entity type must be included in the response  
- If no value for an entity is found show its value as an empty string  
- Attempt zero-shot recognition for `Duration` and `Study Type` and `Species` and `Drug or Compound` and `Route of Administration` and `InternalStudyNumber` and `ExternalStudyNumber` and `TestFacility`  
- Return the result as a JavaScript array of parsable JSON objects for each extracted entity.  
- Use a javascript array in the JSON output if multiple values were extracted for an entity.  

<|Start_Text|>  
{{$input}}
<|End_Text|>
